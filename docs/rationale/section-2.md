# Overview

We primarily use GitHub to manage our code, issues and projects. However we do have a mirror of all our code in a GitLab organization as well.

A link to the organization can be found here: [@fairdataihub](https://gitlab.com/fairdataihub)

::: warning
This organization only exists for the purpose of if we decide to move the code to a different hosting provider. No commits can be pushed to these repositories and no issues will be monitored.
:::

To handle the mirror, we use a GitLab sync action that is already set up for most repositories in the organization. To learn how to set this up for your repository refer to the [workflows](/git/workflows.html#gitlab-sync) section.
