## About

The datasheet.md file is a metadata file popularly used in the machine learning community to document motivation, composition, collection process, recommended uses, and so on of a dataset. It is intended to improve communication between dataset creators and dataset consumers, and encourage the machine learning community to prioritize transparency and accountability.

## Specifications

### Requirement

This metadata is mandatory for all datasets.

### Name and format

This metadata file must be named `datasheet` and must be in the markdown format. The full name with extension must thus be `datasheet.md`.

### Content

The content of this metadata file must be exactly as specified in the ["Datasheets for Datasets"](https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.1803.09010) that introduced the concept for this datasheet. The template provided [here](../../implementing-cds/template.md) specifies the required structure and content.
