# CHANGELOG.md
## About

The CHANGELOG.md is a metadata file that contains information about the changes between different versions of the dataset that are released. This file is intended to provide a human and machine-readable overview of different dataset versions that are released, their release date,
and changes included between the different versions.

## Specifications

### Requirement

This metadata is mandatory for all datasets, including the first release.

### Name and format

This metadata file must be named `CHANGELOG` and must be in the markdown format. The full name with extension must thus be `CHANGELOG.md`.

### Content

The content must be structured following the [Dataset changelog v1.0.0](https://github.com/AI-READI/dataset-changelog) conventions.
