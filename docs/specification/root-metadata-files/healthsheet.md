# healthsheet.md

## About

The healthsheet.md metadata file is based on the healthsheet document established in 2021 to document motivation, composition, collection process, recommended uses, and so on of a healthcare dataset (see [here](https://doi.org/10.1145/3531146.3533239) for more information about healthseet). It is intended to improve communication between dataset creators and dataset consumers, and encourage dataset generators to prioritize transparency and accountability.

## Specifications

### Requirement

This metadata is mandatory for all datasets.

### Name and format

This metadata file must be named `healthsheet` and must be in the markdown format. The full name with extension must thus be `healthsheet.md`.

### Content

The content of this metadata file must be exactly as specified in the paper ["Healthsheet: Development of a Transparency Artifact for Health Datasets"](https://doi.org/10.1145/3531146.3533239) that introduced the concept for this healthsheet. The template provided [here](../../implementing-cds/templates.md) specifies the required structure and content.
