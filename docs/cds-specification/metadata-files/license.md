# LICENSE.txt

## About

The LICENSE.txt is a metadata file that contains the terms under which the dataset is shared. This file is intended to provide a human readable overview of
requirements and conditions for reusing the data.

## Specifications

### Requirement

This metadata is mandatory for all datasets.

### Name and format

This metadata file must be named `LICENSE` and must be in the text format. The full name with extension must thus be `LICENSE.txt`.

### Content

If possible, a standard license from the [Software Package Data Exchange (SPDX) License List](https://spdx.org/licenses/) should be used.
When using a standard license listed in the SPDX license list, the content of this file must be exactly as the text listed in the "Text" section
of that license on the corresponding SPDX page. If another license outside of those listed in the SPDX license list is used, a link to
documentation about the license must be included, if available.
