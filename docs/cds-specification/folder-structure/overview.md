# Release procedure

## Overview

A full release of SODA for SPARC requires two releases. One release on GitHub and another release on Zenodo using [FAIRshare](https://GitHub.com/fairdataihub/FAIRshare). The release on GitHub is used for distributing SODA for SPARC to users. The release on Zenodo is to follow [FAIR](https://www.go-fair.org/fair-principles/) principles.
